                <p>
                    <span>Greetings! I am Amy Austin. I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I've lived and worked in Colorado for
                        the past eighteen years. Originally, I earned an undergraduate degree in Education and Humanities.
                        I had been in education for almost twenty years in Michigan and in Colorado.

                        <p>A life goal of mine has always been to try to change the world, one student at a time, but realized
                            that this was not far-reaching enough. About eight years ago, I began to wonder how else could
                            I make an impact on the world? A concern of mine has always been the environment, and more specifically,
                            climate change and human effects on the top of our land food chain, the polar bear. I traveled
                            to Churchill to get a first hand look at human impact on the polar bear habitat. What I saw was
                            alarming, no ice and wintry landscape when these conditions should have been present. I spoke
                            with biologists at the Polar Bear Research facility about an idea I had to help the polar bears,
                            but my idea was met with speculation. This is when I decided that I would go back to school to
                            become an engineer to try to build my prototype, but would need a lot of coursework and background
                            to accomplish this goal.</p>
                        <p>>I have always been passionate about technology and believe this is another avenue that will help
                            with my prototype. I decided to research multiple coding bootcamps. I was impressed with University
                            of Denver Bootcamp and decided to enroll. I am extremely happy that I did. Additionally, I am
                            taking Calculus 3 and Intro to Python Programming at night. I would like to pursue employment
                            in the web development field while attending Colorado School of Mines either full time or part
                            time beginning in August 2018. </span>
